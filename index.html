            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
               Captain Vikram Batra was a renowned Indian Army officer and a war hero who displayed exceptional courage and bravery during the Kargil War of 1999.
               He was born on September 9, 1974, in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, India.
               <br> Vikram Batra was raised in a middle-class family and had a strong inclination towards the military from a young age.
               Vikram Batra completed his schooling from D.A.V. Public School in Palampur and went on to pursue a bachelor's degree in arts from D.A.V. College in Chandigarh. His desire to serve the nation led him to join the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun in 1996.
               During his training at the IMA, Vikram Batra was known for his discipline, physical fitness, and leadership qualities. 
               He graduated from the academy in December 1997 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Indian Army.<br>
               In May 1999, the Kargil War broke out between India and Pakistan when infiltrators from the Pakistani army and militants occupied strategic positions in the Kargil region of Jammu and Kashmir. It was during this conflict that Captain Vikram Batra's valor and bravery came to the forefront. 
               Captain Vikram Batra, known by his codename "Sher Shah," played a crucial role in the recapture of Point 5140, also known as the "Tiger Hill." On the night of June 19, 1999, he led his team through treacherous terrain and under heavy enemy fire to successfully capture the peak. During the assault, he fearlessly charged at the enemy, encouraging his men and even engaging in hand-to-hand combat. His famous war cry, "Yeh dil maange more!" (This heart craves more!), became a symbol of his indomitable spirit.
               However, the success at Point 5140 came at a great personal cost. Captain Vikram Batra was mortally wounded during the subsequent operations to clear the remaining enemy positions on the hill. He was hit by enemy fire while trying to rescue a fellow officer and succumbed to his injuries on July 7, 1999, at the age of 24.
               Captain Vikram Batra's bravery and sacrifice earned him the highest military honor of India, the Param Vir Chakra, which was awarded posthumously.<br> He became the first and only officer from the Kargil War to receive this prestigious award.
               Vikram Batra's courage and heroism continue to inspire generations of young Indians. He is remembered as a true patriot and a symbol of bravery, selflessness, and leadership. Several books, documentaries, and a Bollywood film titled "Shershaah" have been dedicated to his life and sacrifice, ensuring that his legacy lives on in the hearts of the people.</p>
